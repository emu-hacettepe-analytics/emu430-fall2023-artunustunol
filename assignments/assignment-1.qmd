# Assignment 1

```{r}
1 + 1
```

My first assignment has four parts.

## (a : Choose a video from one of the following sources and provide a brief summary in your Quarto document)

Bu yazıyı değişikleri test etmek için yazıyorum.

## (b: Demonstrate and explain three differences between R and Python (e.g. coding style, syntax etc.) Include coding examples using code chunks.)

## (c : Import the “na_example” data set from the dslabs package.Then replace all NA values in the “na_example” data set with 0, and store it as a new object. After making this change, print the new data frame (the one without NAs) and the total number of NAs in this new data frame)
```{r}

library(dslabs)
data(na_example)
na_example
sum(is.na(na_example))
no_nas <- ifelse(is.na(na_example), 0, na_example)
no_nas
sum(is.na(no_nas))
```

## (d : Render your Quarto website locally and commit your changes to GitHub.)
